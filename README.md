# Quantum Teleportation

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that demonstrates **Quantum Teleportation** — one of the most fascinating protocols in quantum computing.  
Quantum teleportation allows the transfer of an unknown quantum state from one qubit to another **without physically sending the qubit itself**, using **entanglement**, **Bell-state measurements**, and **classical communication**.

## 🔬 What is Quantum Teleportation?

Quantum Teleportation means transferring a quantum state (information) from one particle to another distant one, not the particle itself, using entanglement and classical communication.

This protocol is essential in:
- Quantum communication  
- Quantum networking  
- Quantum cryptography  
- Building future quantum internet
